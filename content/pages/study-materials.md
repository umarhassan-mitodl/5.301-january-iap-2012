The "Digital Lab Techniques Manual" is a series of videos designed to help you prepare for your chemistry laboratory class. Each video provides a detailed demonstration of a common laboratory technique, as well as helpful tips and information. These videos are meant to supplement, and not replace, your lab manual and assigned reading. In fact, you will most benefit from watching the videos if you have already read the appropriate background information. To be a great experimentalist, you must understand both theory and technique! If you have questions about what you see, make sure to ask your TA or your instructor. The full "[Digital Lab Techniques Manual](/courses/res-5-0001-digital-lab-techniques-manual-spring-2007)" is available in our [Supplemental Resources](./resolveuid/461f831cc670b59848f89b47033975ef) section under Chemistry.

These files are also available on [YouTube](http://youtube.com/view_play_list?p=B208D0FA80AD438F).

Note: In 5.301, videos 3, 5, 6, 9, and 10 are used.

[**Reaction Work-Up I**](/courses/res-5-0001-digital-lab-techniques-manual-spring-2007/resources/reaction-work-up-i)

Extracting, Washing and Drying: It ain't over ‘til it's over. Learn how to "work up" your reaction using a separatory funnel to perform a liquid-liquid extraction. This is one purification technique you don't want to miss!

[**Recrystallization**](/courses/res-5-0001-digital-lab-techniques-manual-spring-2007/resources/recrystallization)

Recrystallization takes patience, but it's worth it! This video walks you through the procedure, from solubility tests to cold filtration, with information on one-solvent and two-solvent recrystallizations.

[**Column Chromatography**](/courses/res-5-0001-digital-lab-techniques-manual-spring-2007/resources/column-chromatography)    
It takes considerable practice to master the art of "running a column". This video will get you started, with tips on picking appropriate conditions, packing and running a column, monitoring separation, and even making a micro-column from a pipet.

[**Using a Balance**](/courses/res-5-0001-digital-lab-techniques-manual-spring-2007/resources/using-a-balance)    
Correct usage and maintenance of a balance is a basic skill that is essential in any laboratory procedure.

[**Melting Point Determination**](/courses/res-5-0001-digital-lab-techniques-manual-spring-2007/resources/melting-point-determination)    
Throughout your laboratory experiences, you will frequently need to assess the purity or identity of a crystalline solid. Both of these goals can be accomplished by determining a compound's melting point.

[**Distillation I: Simple & Fractional Distillations**](/courses/res-5-0001-digital-lab-techniques-manual-spring-2007/resources/distillation-i-simple-fractional-distillations)    
Learn how to separate or purify liquid mixtures that boil below 150°C with or without a fractionating column.

[**Distillation II: Vacuum Distillations**](/courses/res-5-0001-digital-lab-techniques-manual-spring-2007/resources/distillation-ii-vacuum-distillations)    
Do you need to purify a liquid that boils above 150°C? This video shows you how to perform a distillation under vacuum.

[**Refluxing a Reaction**](/courses/res-5-0001-digital-lab-techniques-manual-spring-2007/resources/refluxing-a-reaction)    
Most organic reactions occur slowly at room temperature and require heat to allow them to go to completion in a reasonable time frame. Running a reaction under reflux allows you to heat a reaction without losing solvent due to evaporation and with causing an explosion.
