### Equipment

*   Separatory funnel—250 or 500-mL
*   Graduated Cylinder—100-mL
*   Erlenmeyer flasks—2x250-mL, 1x500-mL
*   Beaker 150-mL
*   Round-bottomed flasksv50-mL, 100-mL
*   NMR tubes
*   IR cards
*   Funnels—large, with long neck
*   Filter Paper
*   Rotary evaporator

### Goal

To manipulate and purify a known amount of a contaminated sample and to record its {{< sup "1" >}}H NMR and IR spectra, all with minimal loss of material.

### Experiment Outline

*   You will receive a vial containing 100 mg of ethyl 3-hydroxybenzoate (mp 72–74 °C) contaminated with triethylamine. You will also receive four different {{< sup "1" >}}H NMR spectra of: the mixture in your vial, pure ethyl 3-hydroxybenzoate, pure triethylamine, and diethyl ether.  
      
    {{< resource 5576c89a-d275-f6de-9f7b-47a6cde388c3 >}}
*   Dissolve the sample in 50–75 mL of ether in a separatory funnel.
*   Remove the amine by extraction with a 10% HCl solution.
*   Continue with the "standard aqueous work-up" (including an ether back extraction)—_see Extraction and Washing Guide_.
*   Remove the solvent by rotary evaporation and concentration under vacuum to a constant weight and obtain a mass.
*   Take an NMR spectrum of the compound and compare to your earlier spectra.
*   Recombine the NMR sample with the remainder of the purified sample.
*   Obtain an IR spectrum using your IR card—see IR Sample Prep. Guide.
*   Remove the solvent for the final time to a constant weight.
*   Obtain a mass and a melting point.

### Notes

*   When removing solvent with the rotary evaporator, keep the receiving flask cold and the water bath warm. Otherwise, your product will never solidify.
*   If you have trouble getting your product to solidify, add a few milliliters of methylene chloride to your flask and return it to the rotary evaporator.

### Results

*   To obtain your "CC Rating" in Transfer and Extraction Techniques, you must end with at least 90 mg of ethyl 3-hydroxybenzoate. Additionally, this material must be of adequate purity as determined by IR and {{< sup "1" >}}H NMR analysis (spectra should show only negligible amounts of impurities in the judgment of the professor and TA) and by melting point measurement (should melt over no more than three degrees with the lower range beginning no lower than 69 °C and the upper range ending no higher than 73 °C). This material must also be submitted to the TA for possible weight and melting point confirmation measurements.
