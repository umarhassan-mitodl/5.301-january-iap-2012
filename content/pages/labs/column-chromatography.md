5.1 - Competent Chemist Rating
------------------------------

> _"Looks Are Sometimes Deceiving"_

### Techniques Checklist

*   Analyzing mixtures by TLC
*   Assembling a silica gel column
*   Applying crude mixtures to a silica gel column
*   Separating simple mixtures with a silica gel column

### Pre-lab Discussion

*   Theory of column chromatography—Reading Zubrick chapter 28, Mohrig chapter 18
*   TLC—polarity/solvent sys—Reading Zubrick chapter 27, LLP chapter 9.3.1, Mohrig chapter 17
*   Setting up silica gel column Reading Zubrick chapter 31, LLP chapter 11.6, Mohrig chapter 18
*   Applying crude mixtures to the column
*   Running a flash column

### Digital Lab Techniques Manual

*   Video 3, [TLC: The Basics](/courses/res-5-0001-digital-lab-techniques-manual-spring-2007/resources/tlc-the-basics)
*   Video 10, [Column Chromatography](/courses/res-5-0001-digital-lab-techniques-manual-spring-2007/resources/column-chromatography)

### Equipment

*   Flash Chromatography Column
*   Air Flow apparatus (Stopper, T-valve, Screw clamp, tubing)
*   Round-bottomed flasks—1x100-mL, 2x500-mL
*   Test tubes—18x150 mm
*   Test tube racks
*   TLC plates—cut silica/glass plates and UV lamp
*   Large plastic funnels

### Goal

*   Purify a contaminated compound using silica gel flash column chromatography.

### Experiment Outline

*   You will be given 2 mL of an ether/pentane solution containing 1.00 g of benzylacetone contaminated with a small amount of guaiazulene.
*   Analyze this mixture by TLC—_see TLC Guide_, using 10% ethyl acetate/hexanes as the solvent system.
*   Record the R{{< sub "f" >}} values.
*   Prepare the column in the hood, using 10% ether/pentane and 50 g (about 5'') of of silica gel—_see Flash Column Chromatography Guide_.
*   Elute the column with 10mL of pentane—Apply your sample to the column, being careful not to disturb the top layer of sand. Rinse the sample flask three times with 1 mL pentane each, and use the rinses to wash the sides of the column.
*   Run the column, monitoring the fractions by TLC—_See Flash Chromatography Guide and TLC Guide_.
*   Concentrate the set of fractions containing pure benzylacetone.
*   Weigh the purified compound and prepare a GC and GC-MS sample.
*   Check product with TLC and obtain a GC and GC-MS spectrum.

### Results

*   To obtain your "CC Rating" in Purification by Flash Column Chromatography, you should collect at least 0.95 g of benzylacetone. This sample must be at least 95% pure as demonstrated by GC spectroscopy. Your sample must also be submitted to the TA for possible weight and purity verification.

5.2 - Expert Experimentalist
----------------------------

### Techniques Checklist

*   Picking the correct eluent then adsorbtion of a crude mixture onto silica gel
*   Separating complex mixtures—using gradient elution

### Pre-lab Discussion

*   Suggest limited list of eluent solvent systems
*   Discuss sample adsorption and gradient elution strategies

### Equipment

*   Identical to CC Level

### Goal

Separate mixture of three compounds using gradient elution flash column chromatography.

### Chemical Data

*   Benzylacetone—FW 148.21, bp 235 °C, d 0.989
*   Benzylideneacetone—FW 146.19, mp 39–41 °C
*   3-Methylanisole—FW 122.17, bp 175–176 °C, d 0.969

{{< resource b30ed09f-f1b6-dcda-701f-247cd838cfd9 >}}

### Experiment Outline

*   You will be given 1.00 g of a mixture containing 0.60 g of the major ketone, 0.20g of the minor ketone, and 0.20g of methylanisole in 20 ml of an ether/ hexane solution.
*   Analyze this mixture by TLC using various solvent systems—_see TLC Guide for hints_.
*   Pick an eluent.
*   Decide on the silica gel to compound ratio.
*   Prepare the column.
*   Deposit the mixture on silica gel, dry completely, then apply to the column.
*   Run the column.
*   Concentrate pure fractions.
*   Weigh the purified compounds.
*   Analyze the pure ketones by NMR and TLC.

### Note

*   The ketones are somewhat volatile, and 3-methylanisole, with its low molecular weight, is much more so. Therefore, do not concentrate it (or a mixture containing it) using the vacuum pump.

### Results

*   To obtain your "EE Rating" in Purification by Flash Column Chromatography, you should get at least 0.45 g of the major ketone and 0.13 g of the minor ketone, and 0.13 g of methylanisole. These samples must be at least 95% pure as demonstrated by NMR spectroscopy. Your samples must also be submitted to the TA for possible weight and purity verification.
